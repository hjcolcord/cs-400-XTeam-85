# X-Team 85 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will try to evenly balance the workload so that no one team member will be doing too much. When the project is assigned
we will break it into even pieces for each team member. If a team member cannot complete a task, that team member will communicate their issue to the team via text, and the team will determine the best course of action.



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Team will notify each other when steps of the project have been completed by a specified date. Team members will create "due dates" before the final due date to complete their respective pieces.



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Team will communicate problems with each other through text or email. If a team member is stuggling, they can request to meet with other members for help.



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Teammates will text eachother in the group chat frequently to get updates on how each member's piece of the project is going. If a team member is struggling, other members will offer help and support if they deem it necessary. Team will use a Google Calendar (a shared calendar that each team member can access online) to update and keep track of due dates.



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Constructive critism is always better than being negative. When team member are helping each other on problems, they will only provide comments or help that is constructive, not that is negative or with intent to tear each other down.
